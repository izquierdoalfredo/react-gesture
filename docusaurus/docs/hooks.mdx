## List of hooks

React-use-gesture exports several hooks that can handle different gestures:

| Hook         | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `useDrag`    | Handles the drag gesture                   |
| `useMove`    | Handles mouse move events                  |
| `useHover`   | Handles mouse enter and mouse leave events |
| `useScroll`  | Handles scroll events                      |
| `useWheel`   | Handles wheel events                       |
| `usePinch`   | Handles the pinch gesture                  |
| `useGesture` | Handles multiple gestures in one hook      |

## Usage

With the exception of `useGesture` which is a special hook, all other hooks share the same API:

```jsx {1-100}
const bind = useDrag(state => doSomethingWith(state), config)
return <div {...bind(arg)} />
```

- _`state`_ is an object containing all attributes of the gesture, including the original event. That state is passed to your handler every time the gesture updates. You can find all state attributes.
- _`config`_ is an object containing options for the gesture. You can find all config options here.
- _`arg`_ is a custom argument you can pass to the bind function. See this example to see where it can be useful.

## Handling multiple gestures in one hook with useGesture

_`useGesture`_ is a hook that allows you to manage different gestures at once: for example you might want to enable pinching and dragging on the same component, in that case `useGesture` is the way to go.

```jsx {1-100}
const bind = useGesture(
  {
    onDrag: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onDragStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onDragEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onPinch: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onPinchStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onPinchEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onScroll: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onScrollStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onScrollEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onMove: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onMoveStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onMoveEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onWheel: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onWheelStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onWheelEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onHover: state => doSomethingWith(state)
  },
  config
)
return <div {...bind()} />
```

The _`config`_ object passed to `useGesture` has `drag`, `wheel`, `scroll`, `pinch` and `move` keys for specific gesture options. See here for more details.

### Start and end handlers

As you can see from the snippet above, the `useGesture` hook allows `drag`, `wheel`, `scroll`, `pinch` and `move` gestures to have two additional handlers that let you perform actions when they start or end. For example, _`onScrollEnd`_ fires when the user just finished scrolling.

Note that **end event handlers** for `wheel`, `scroll` and `move` are **debounced** because of the way these events work in the DOM.

### Native React event handlers

Imagine you want to add an action when you mouse down on a draggable component. You'll probably be tempted to try the following code at first:

```jsx {1,4-11}
// This won't work as you'd expect
function DragAndMouseDown() {
  const [{ x, y }, set] = useSpring(() => ({ x: 0, y: 0 }))
  const bind = useDrag(({ down, offset: [x, y] }) => set({ x, y }))
  return (
    <animated.div
      {...bind()}
      onMouseDown={() => console.log('mouse down')}
      style={{ x, y }}
    />
  )
}
```

This looks fine on paper, but it actually won't work: the reason is that the attribute _`onMouseDown`_ will overwrite the one created by expanding _`{...bind()}`_ and therefore the drag gesture won't start.

Fortunately, the hook _`useGesture`_ supports native React event handlers, and will make sure they are executed on the side without overwriting anything:

```jsx {1,4-7}
// This will work as intended
function DragAndMouseDown() {
  const [{ x, y }, set] = useSpring(() => ({ x: 0, y: 0 }))
  const bind = useGesture({
    onDrag: ({ down, offset: [x, y] }) => set({ x, y }),
    onMouseDown: () => console.log('mouse down')
  })
  return <animated.div {...bind()} style={{ x, y }} />
}
```
