# Why use React UseGesture

<p>
  <ReactUseGesture /> is a library that focuses on making complex gestures such as drag and pinch easy to configure.
</p>

In most situations, `onDrag` becomes as easy to set up as `onMouseMove`. However, you remain in control of the full gesture logic, which allows you to make your components behave exactly the way you want.

## Augmenting events

A secondary aspect of <ReactUseGesture/> is to upgrade gestures with additional kinematics attributes, such as **velocity**, **distance**, **delta** and more, that don't come with native browser events.

<ReactUseGesture /> also debounces `scroll`, `wheel` and `move` events, which gives you the capacity to [trigger logic
when the gesture starts or ends out of the box](/docs/hooks/#start-and-end-handlers).

## Going further

Alexandra Holachek ([site](https://alex.holachek.com/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/alex_holachek)) gave a great talk at React Conf about Progressive Web Animations, where she explains the principles of her approach on creating native-like UI. Her demos use React-spring and <ReactUseGesture/>. Alex's talk strongly influenced some of the features in <ReactUseGesture/>.
