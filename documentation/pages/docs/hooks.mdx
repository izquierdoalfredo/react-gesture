# Available hooks

React UseGesture exports several hooks that can handle different gestures.

| Hook         | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `useDrag`    | Handles the drag gesture                   |
| `useMove`    | Handles mouse move events                  |
| `useHover`   | Handles mouse enter and mouse leave events |
| `useScroll`  | Handles scroll events                      |
| `useWheel`   | Handles wheel events                       |
| `usePinch`   | Handles the pinch gesture                  |
| `useGesture` | Handles multiple gestures in one hook      |

## Usage

With the exception of `useGesture` which is a special hook, all other hooks share the same API:

```jsx {1-100}
const bind = useDrag(state => doSomethingWith(state), config)
return <div {...bind(arg)} />
```

- `state` is an object containing all attributes of the gesture, including the original event. That state is passed to your handler every time the gesture updates. You can find all state attributes in the [Gesture state section](state.mdx).
- `config` is an object containing options for the gesture. You can find all config options in the [Gesture options section](options.mdx).
- `arg` is a custom argument you can pass to the bind function. See this [example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fh8r8) to see where it can be useful.

## Handling multiple gestures in one hook with useGesture

`useGesture` is a hook that allows you to manage different gestures at once: for example you might want to enable pinching and dragging on the same component, in that case `useGesture` is the way to go.

```jsx {1-100}
const bind = useGesture(
  {
    onDrag: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onDragStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onDragEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onPinch: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onPinchStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onPinchEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onScroll: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onScrollStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onScrollEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onMove: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onMoveStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onMoveEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onWheel: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onWheelStart: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onWheelEnd: state => doSomethingWith(state),
    onHover: state => doSomethingWith(state),
  },
  config
)
return <div {...bind()} />
```

The `config` object passed to `useGesture` has `drag`, `wheel`, `scroll`, `pinch` and `move` keys for specific gesture options. See here for more details.

### Start and end handlers

As you can see from the snippet above, the `useGesture` hook allows `drag`, `wheel`, `scroll`, `pinch` and `move` gestures to have two additional handlers that let you perform actions when they start or end. For example, `onScrollEnd` fires when the user just finished scrolling.

Note that **end event handlers** for `wheel`, `scroll` and `move` are **debounced** because of the way these events work in the DOM.

### Native React event handlers

Imagine you want to add an action when you mouse down on a draggable component. You'll probably be tempted to try the following code at first:

```jsx {1,4-11}
// This won't work as you'd expect
function DragAndMouseDown() {
  const [{ x, y }, set] = useSpring(() => ({ x: 0, y: 0 }))
  const bind = useDrag(({ down, offset: [x, y] }) => set({ x, y }))
  return <animated.div {...bind()} onMouseDown={() => console.log('mouse down')} style={{ x, y }} />
}
```

This looks fine on paper, but it actually won't work: the reason is that the attribute `onMouseDown` will overwrite the one created by expanding `{...bind()}` and therefore the drag gesture won't start.

Fortunately, the hook `useGesture` supports native React event handlers, and will make sure they are executed on the side without overwriting anything:

```jsx {1,4-7}
// This will work as intended
function DragAndMouseDown() {
  const [{ x, y }, set] = useSpring(() => ({ x: 0, y: 0 }))
  const bind = useGesture({
    onDrag: ({ down, offset: [x, y] }) => set({ x, y }),
    onMouseDown: ({ event, ...sharedState }) => console.log('mouse down', event),
  })
  return <animated.div {...bind()} style={{ x, y }} />
}
```

Even better, the native handler will be passed the shared state of the gestures, including the original event, and the arguments passed to the `bind` function.
